## Trip Budget Tracker App
This app allows the user to track how much money has been saved for an upcoming trip or vacation. The user can add new trips, and edit the budget for the trip. The user can also add trip destination ideas to the wish list.

This app was created using React for the front-end, and Express, Knex.js, PostgreSQL, in Node.js for the back-end. Chart.js was also used to help visualize how much money is left to save for an upcoming trip.
